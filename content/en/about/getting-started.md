# Introduction

## About Me

Hi! I am **David Aganov**, a frontend developer. I build web applications that are a pleasure to use: from neat layouts and components to well-thought-out logic, architecture, and performance.

## My Experience

I have 5 years of experience in frontend development and 1.5 years in backend development. I dive into tasks quickly and always deliver results.

- I value clean code, strict typing, and routine automation
- I aim for long-term and productive cooperation

## What You Can Find Here

This portfolio is a place where I collect my work and notes:

- projects (personal projects, open source)
- my tech stack and development approach
- contacts and links

If you want to quickly understand what I do, you can start with the projects. If you are more interested in "how I think and work," take a look at the section with the stack, articles, and notes.
